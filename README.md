Insurify Insurance Year in Review
Created by Team 15 

Life events and changes in household budgets can significantly impact insurance needs. As an Insurify customer, feeling protected and having a clear understanding of policy coverage is paramount for peace of mind. The goal is to streamline the review process, ensuring that Insurify understands customers' evolving needs and provides timely and relevant recommendations. To address common customer queries regarding discounts, optimized coverages, how coverages work, and the impact of life changes on insurance, we present "A Year in Review."

Overview
"A Year in Review" is an automated, friendly narrative that mirrors the personalized touch of Spotify's Year in Review playlist. This innovative approach aims to transform the traditional protection review into a digital, non-linear, and unscripted experience. By presenting complex information in an easy-to-understand format, we strive to engage customers in a meaningful way.

Key Features
Personalized Storytelling: Create a more personal connection with customers by delivering a narrative that reflects their unique protection needs and past events.

Engaging Experience: Make the protection review process engaging, ensuring that customers not only understand their coverage but also recognize the value they receive from their insurance.

Importance of Protection Reviews
Protection reviews hold a pivotal role in the customer experience, setting Insurify apart from its competitors. According to JD Power, Allstate's significant opportunity lies in ensuring customers have a complete understanding of their policy coverage. Leveraging protection reviews as a key performance indicator (KPI) is not only crucial in itself but also serves as the most effective way to explain coverage details. While Allstate excels in informing customers about additional products and services, there is an opportunity to enhance the communication of this information to more than half of its customer base.

How It Works
Automation: The process is automated, ensuring efficiency and consistency in delivering protection reviews to all customers.

User-Friendly Interface: The digital, non-linear experience is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for customers to navigate and comprehend complex information.

Personalization Algorithms: Utilize advanced algorithms to tailor the content of the protection review based on individual customer profiles and historical data.
